##Class-Incremental SAR Ship Detection and Classificaiton via Context-Robust Exemplar Replay and Multigranularity Knowledege Distillation

This project is based on the [SRSDD v1.0 Dataset](https://github.com/HeuristicLU/SRSDD-V1.0) for training and experimentation. SRSDD is a high-quality dataset for road surface defect detection, containing annotations for various ship types.

## Dataset Source

The SRSDD v1.0 dataset was curated and released by our team. It includes:
- **Images**: High-resolution road surface images.
- **Annotations**: COCO-format annotation files, compatible with frameworks like Detectron2.
